# sqlite3

This is the temporary home of SQLite3. It will move into dksdk-cmake
when it has been verified to work on the supported platforms.
(At the same time "lwt" should be upstreamed as well).

The vcpkg port https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/sqlite3
was used. This is subject to the vcpkg license.
