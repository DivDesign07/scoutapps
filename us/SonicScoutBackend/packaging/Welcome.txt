Welcome to Sonic Scout!

Squirrel Scout is a First Robotics team from Glacier Peak High School, Washington State, USA.
Two high school juniors (Archit Kumar and Keyush Attarde) wrote the initial versions of the Sonic Scout software with some help from Diskuv.
Keeping with the First Robotics value system, the software has been released for use by other robotics teams.

Each year the First Robotics competitions change.
The "official" release of the scouting software will always be one year prior.
In simpler terms ... the software you may be running may be OUT OF DATE.
To be one step ahead of the other robotics teams, your team should modify the scouting software.

Visit https://github.com/diskuv/scoutapps for help modifying the software.
