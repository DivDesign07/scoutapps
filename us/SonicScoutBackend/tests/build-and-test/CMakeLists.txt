# These tests are for `ctest --build-and-test` style tests.
# They are not used often, but are useful when
# - Your project defines CMake functions for use by other
#   projects. Those CMake functions can be tested here in
#   a CMake project separate from the main CMake project.
# - Your project generates source code. That source code
#   can be generated in the main CMake project and then
#   tested here in a separate CMake project.
